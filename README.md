## Exercise
For all the following questions, explain the git command, and its options. The first one is done as an example.

Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. You can add all changes in the working directory by using `git add .`. You can also just add a file by specifying the name and path of the file `git add <file_path>`. This DOES NOT commit the change.
* `git fetch`
* `git commit`
* `git branch -d | git branch -D`
* `git reset`
* `git revert`
* `git cherry-pick`
* `git rebase`
